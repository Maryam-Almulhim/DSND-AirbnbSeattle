## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this project, I'll explore and analyse Seattle's Airbnb data 2016. This project will answer three questions:

1- What are the main factors that effect Airbnb listing prices?

2- What are the price peaks in 2016, any outlier neighborhoods?

3- Is there a correlation betwwen the review type (positive/negative) and the neighbourhood group?
