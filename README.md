## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this project, I'll explore and analyse Seattle's Airbnb data 2016. This project will answer three questions:

1- What are the main factors that effect Airbnb listing prices?

2- What are the price peaks in 2016, any outlier neighborhoods? 

3- Is there a correlation betwwen the reviewer's number of reviews and the listing rating?
